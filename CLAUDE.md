# Project Instructions

## Skills Development

When working on skills (creating, editing, or debugging skills in this project), fetch the official Anthropic skills documentation first:

```
WebFetch: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills
Prompt: Extract the complete guide for creating, configuring, and best practices for Claude Code skills
```

This ensures we follow current best practices and avoid hallucinations about skill syntax and capabilities.
